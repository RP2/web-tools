# Riley's Online Tools

Welcome to Riley's Online Tools! This is a collection of free and open-source tools that I've created for various purposes. You can find them in the `tools` directory.

## Teleprompter

The teleprompter tool allows you to display text on a screen as it scrolls, which can be useful for presentations or other situations where you need to read from a script. There is also an option to set the scroll speed and pause/resume the scrolling.

## Diff Checker

The diff checker tool compares two pieces of text and highlights the differences between them. This can be useful for reviewing code changes or comparing documents. There is also an option to select a hash type (MD5, SHA-1, etc.) if you need to compare files.

You can find more information about each tool in their respective directories.
